📌 Zomato Data Analysis Project
📖 Overview
This project analyzes Zomato restaurant data using Python to uncover insights into customer preferences, restaurant ratings, order trends, and more. The analysis is performed using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly for data exploration and visualization.

🎯 Objectives
The analysis aims to answer the following key questions:
1️⃣ What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
2️⃣ How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
3️⃣ What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
4️⃣ Zomato has observed that most couples order food online. What is their average spending per order?
5️⃣ Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?
6️⃣ Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, so that Zomato can target customers with good offers?
